# Day 3 - Python Functions & Functional Programming

## 📌 Topics Covered
- Understanding Functions in Python
- Function Arguments & Return Values
- Lambda Functions (Anonymous Functions)
- Functional Programming: `map()`, `filter()`, `reduce()`
- Mini-Project: Processing CSV Data with Functional Programming

## 🚀 What I Did Today
- Revised the fundamentals of **Python functions** and their real-world applications.
- Explored **lambda functions** and how they help write concise code.
- Used **`map()`**, **`filter()`**, and **`reduce()`** to process data efficiently.
- Implemented a **mini-project** that reads a CSV file, filters numbers >50, and calculates their sum.

## 📂 Files in This Folder
- **`Python_Functions_Basics.ipynb`** → Covers basic function concepts.
- **`Advanced_Functions_Map_Filter_Reduce.ipynb`** → Focuses on functional programming techniques.
- **`data/data.csv`** → Sample dataset for the mini-project.

## 📈 Key Takeaways
- Functions make code modular and reusable.
- Lambda functions are handy for short operations.
- Functional programming concepts are powerful for data manipulation.

💡 **Excited to apply these concepts in real-world data science tasks!**
