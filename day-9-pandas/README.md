🚀 Day 9: Mastering Pandas Operations!

Today, I dived deeper into Pandas Operations and worked on filtering, grouping, and aggregation using real-world sales data. 📊

🔍 What I Learned Today:
✅ Filtering Data: Extracted specific rows based on conditions (e.g., sales > $500, female customers, specific product lines).
✅ Grouping & Aggregation: Used groupby() to analyze total sales per product line, average rating per city, and total quantity sold per branch.
✅ Data-Driven Insights: Discovered patterns in customer purchases and sales trends!

🔥 Key Takeaway:
Pandas is a game-changer for data manipulation! Efficiently filtering and aggregating data helps uncover valuable insights that drive business decisions.

💡 Next, I’ll be diving into NumPy to enhance my numerical computing skills!
